# Cost Calculation Fix Documentation

## Issue

The application was showing $0 or NaN in the summary table because of issues with the cost calculation flow. The main problems were:

1. **CPT Code Lookup Issues**: The CPT code lookup was not properly falling back to sample values when database retrieval failed.
2. **Geographic Factor Issues**: The geographic factors were being retrieved but not properly validated, leading to NaN values.
3. **Fallback Mechanism Issues**: The fallback mechanisms were not working correctly, resulting in zero costs.

## Solution

The solution was to enhance the cost calculation flow to ensure that costs are never zero or NaN:

1. **Enhanced CPT Code Lookup**:
   - Improved the fallback mechanism to ensure it always returns valid data
   - Added more logging to help diagnose issues
   - Enhanced the sample values function to ensure it always returns valid data

2. **Fixed Geographic Factor Application**:
   - Ensured geographic factors are always valid numbers
   - Enhanced the applyGeoFactors function to handle null or undefined values
   - Added more logging for debugging

3. **Improved Adjusted Cost Service**:
   - Enhanced the fallback mechanism to ensure costs are never zero or NaN
   - Improved the CPT code data handling
   - Added more logging for debugging

4. **Fixed Item Cost Service**:
   - Enhanced the fallback mechanism to use non-zero values

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/calculations/services/cptCodeService.ts`
2. `src/utils/calculations/services/geoFactorsService.ts`
3. `src/utils/calculations/services/adjustedCostService.ts`
4. `src/utils/calculations/services/itemCostService.ts`

## Testing

The fix was tested using a custom test script (`test-cost-calculation-debug.mjs`) that verifies:

1. Direct CPT code lookup using the database connection
2. Geographic factor lookup and application
3. Cost calculation flow with the updated services

The application can be restarted with the fix using the `restart_app_with_cost_calculation_fix.mjs` script.

## Expected Results

After applying this fix, the summary table should correctly display cost values instead of $0 or NaN. The cost calculation flow will now work correctly with proper fallback mechanisms in place.
