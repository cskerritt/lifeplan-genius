# Cost Calculation System Refactoring

## Overview

The cost calculation system has been refactored to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and make the system more extensible. This document outlines the changes made and the benefits of the new architecture.

## Key Changes

### 1. Strategy Pattern Implementation

The cost calculation logic has been refactored to use the Strategy pattern, which allows for different calculation strategies based on the input parameters:

- **OneTimeCostStrategy**: Handles one-time cost calculations
- **RecurringCostStrategy**: Handles recurring cost calculations
- **AgeIncrementCostStrategy**: Handles age increment cost calculations

This approach makes the code more modular and easier to extend with new calculation methods in the future.

### 2. Common Utilities Extraction

Common functionality has been extracted into utility files:

- **costAdjustmentUtils.ts**: Contains utilities for calculating and applying geographic factors
- **errorUtils.ts**: Provides standardized error handling across the codebase

This reduces code duplication and ensures consistent behavior across the system.

### 3. Improved Error Handling

Error handling has been standardized across the codebase, with a consistent approach to logging errors and providing fallback values.

### 4. Enhanced Testing

The refactoring includes improved test coverage with:

- Unit tests for the item cost service
- Enhanced test scripts that can run both automated tests and manual verification

### 5. Better Separation of Concerns

The refactored code has a clearer separation of concerns:

- **Strategy Classes**: Handle the specific calculation logic
- **Factory Class**: Determines which strategy to use
- **Service Layer**: Coordinates validation and strategy execution
- **Utility Functions**: Provide reusable functionality

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: The code is now more maintainable with smaller, focused components
2. **Extensibility**: New calculation strategies can be added without modifying existing code
3. **Testability**: The modular design makes it easier to write unit tests
4. **Readability**: The code is more readable with clear responsibilities for each component
5. **Consistency**: Common patterns are used consistently throughout the codebase

## MFU/PFR Average Factor Fix

The original fix for applying the average of MFU and PFR factors has been preserved in the refactored code. The key aspects of this fix are:

1. Calculating the average of MFU and PFR factors
2. Applying this average factor to costs instead of applying MFU and PFR factors separately
3. Using the average factor for all cost sources (MFU, PFR, or base costs)

This ensures that geographic adjustments are properly applied to annual cost calculations.

## Testing

To test the refactored code, run:

```bash
node test-mfu-pfr-avg-fix.js
```

This will:
1. Run automated tests if they exist
2. Open the application in a browser for manual verification

Verify that:
1. The application loads without errors
2. Cost calculations are performed correctly with the average of MFU and PFR factors
3. Annual costs reflect the proper application of geographic adjustments

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Adding more specialized calculation strategies for different scenarios
2. Implementing dependency injection for better testability
3. Adding more comprehensive automated tests
4. Creating a visualization tool for calculation steps
