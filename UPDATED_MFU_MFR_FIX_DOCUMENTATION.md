# Updated MFU/MFR Field Name Fix Documentation

## Issue

There was an inconsistency in the codebase regarding how Medicare fee values were referenced:

- The database and CPTCode interface use `mfu_*` prefixes for Medicare fee values (e.g., `mfu_50th`, `mfu_75th`, `mfu_90th`)
- However, some parts of the code were incorrectly referencing these values with `mfr_*` prefixes (e.g., `mfr_50th`, `mfr_75th`, `mfr_90th`)

This inconsistency was causing issues with fee lookups, as the code was trying to access properties that didn't exist or had different names than expected. The console logs showed that while PFR (Private Fee Relative) values were being correctly accessed, the MFR (Medicare Fee Relative) values were showing as undefined.

## Solution

The solution was to update all references to ensure consistent use of `mfu_*` fields for Medicare fee values:

1. Updated the comments in `useCostCalculations.ts` to clarify that MFR data is stored as `mfu_*` in the database
2. Enhanced the log messages to make it clear that we're using `mfu_*` fields for MFR data

These changes ensure that the code correctly accesses the Medicare fee values from the database, which resolves the issues with fee lookups and cost calculations.

### Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useCostCalculations.ts`
   - Updated comments to clarify that MFR data is stored as `mfu_*` in the database
   - Enhanced log messages to make it clear that we're using `mfu_*` fields for MFR data

### Important Notes

- The `mfr_factor` and `pfr_factor` fields were NOT changed, as these are correctly named and separate from the Medicare fee values
- The variable names in the code (e.g., `rawMfr50th`, `adjustedMfr50th`) were kept the same for consistency, even though they now reference `mfu_*` fields
- This fix ensures that the code correctly accesses the Medicare fee values from the database, which should resolve any issues with fee lookups

## Testing

To test this fix, run the application using the provided restart script:

```bash
node restart_app_with_updated_mfu_fix.js
```

Verify that:
1. The application starts without errors
2. Fee lookups work correctly
3. Cost calculations are performed correctly
4. The console no longer shows undefined values for MFR data

## Verification

A verification script has been created to test the fix:

```bash
node verify-mfu-fix.js
```

This script:
1. Looks up a CPT code directly to see the raw data
2. Logs both `mfu_*` and `mfr_*` fields to verify which ones exist
3. Verifies that `mfu_*` fields exist and have values
4. Verifies that `mfr_*` fields don't exist or are undefined
5. Verifies that `pfr_*` fields exist and have values

The fix ensures that the code correctly uses `mfu_*` fields for Medicare fee values, which should resolve the issues with fee lookups and cost calculations.
