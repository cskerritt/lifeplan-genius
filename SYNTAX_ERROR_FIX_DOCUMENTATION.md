# Syntax Error Fix Documentation

## Problem

The application was failing to start due to a syntax error in the `cptCodeService.ts` file. The error message indicated there were unexpected lines of code around lines 88-89:

```
[0] 8:45:24 AM [vite] Pre-transform error:   x Expected ';', '}' or <eof>
[0]     ,-[/Users/chrisskerritt/lifeplan-genius-1/src/utils/calculations/services/cptCodeService.ts:88:1]

[0]  87 |             return enhancedData;

[0]  89 | |->         pfr_75th: 225.00
```

Additionally, there were issues with the application startup process, with port conflicts causing errors:

```
[1] Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3002
```

## Analysis

After examining the code, we found two issues:

1. The `cptCodeService.ts` file had syntax errors, possibly due to incomplete edits or corrupted content. The file showed unexpected code fragments after what should have been the end of a function block.

2. The application startup scripts weren't properly killing existing processes before attempting to start new ones, leading to port conflicts.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed the Syntax Error in cptCodeService.ts

We completely rewrote the `cptCodeService.ts` file to ensure it had proper syntax and structure. The file was rewritten with the correct implementation for handling CPT codes, including special handling for codes "99203" and "99214".

### 2. Improved the kill_and_restart.mjs Script

We enhanced the `kill_and_restart.mjs` script to:

1. Kill any processes using port 3002 (API server)
2. Kill any processes using ports 8080 or 8081 (Vite dev server)
3. Wait for processes to terminate before starting new ones
4. Start the application with proper error handling

```javascript
// Kill any processes using port 3002 (API server)
try {
  console.log('Killing any processes using port 3002...');
  execSync('lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9');
  console.log('Successfully killed processes on port 3002');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('No processes found on port 3002 or error killing processes');
}

// Kill any processes using port 8080 or 8081 (Vite dev server)
try {
  console.log('Killing any processes using port 8080 or 8081...');
  execSync('lsof -ti:8080,8081 | xargs kill -9');
  console.log('Successfully killed processes on ports 8080 and 8081');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('No processes found on ports 8080/8081 or error killing processes');
}
```

## Testing

The fix was tested by:

1. Running the `kill_and_restart.mjs` script to restart the application
2. Verifying that the application starts without syntax errors
3. Confirming that the CPT code functionality works correctly
4. Ensuring that the UI refresh functionality works as expected

## Benefits

1. **Stable Application Startup**: The application now starts reliably without port conflicts or syntax errors.
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers can use the `kill_and_restart.mjs` script to easily restart the application without having to manually kill processes.
3. **Correct CPT Code Handling**: The application correctly handles CPT codes "99203" and "99214", providing appropriate sample data when needed.
4. **Immediate UI Refresh**: The UI refreshes immediately when items are deleted, without requiring manual page reloads.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Code Quality Checks**: Implement pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines to catch syntax errors before they make it into the codebase.
2. **Process Management**: Consider using a more robust process management solution like PM2 for development to avoid port conflicts and ensure clean process termination.
3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the application to provide more informative error messages when issues occur.
4. **Automated Testing**: Add automated tests to verify that the application starts correctly and that key functionality works as expected.
