# Cost Calculation Testing Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive testing framework for the care services cost calculation system. This framework is designed to test all combinations of service types and frequencies to ensure there are no bugs or errors in the calculations.

## Files Created

1. **src/utils/calculations/__tests__/costCalculationMatrix.test.ts**
   - Jest test suite that tests a subset of combinations
   - Includes tests for each category, frequency pattern, and edge case

2. **src/utils/calculations/__tests__/testDataGenerator.ts**
   - Utility to generate test combinations
   - Provides functions to generate all combinations or a representative subset

3. **src/utils/calculations/__tests__/runComprehensiveTests.js**
   - Script to run tests for all combinations
   - Validates results and reports failures

4. **test-cost-calculations.js**
   - Main test runner script
   - Supports generating HTML reports

5. **run-cost-calculation-tests.sh**
   - Shell script to run the tests and open the report
   - Supports command-line arguments

6. **test-specific-combination.mjs**
   - Example script to test specific combinations
   - Useful for debugging or verifying specific scenarios

7. **COST_CALCULATION_TESTING.md**
   - Detailed documentation of the testing approach
   - Instructions for running and extending the tests

## Testing Approach

The testing framework uses a matrix-based approach to test all possible combinations of:

1. **Care Categories** (13 categories)
2. **Frequency Types** (20+ patterns)
3. **Duration Scenarios** (3 types)
4. **Geographic Adjustment Scenarios** (3 scenarios)
5. **CPT Code Scenarios** (5 scenarios)
6. **Age Increment Scenarios** (2 scenarios)
7. **Edge Cases** (5+ cases)

## How to Use

### Basic Testing

To run the basic Jest test suite:

```bash
npm test -- src/utils/calculations/__tests__/costCalculationMatrix.test.ts
```

### Comprehensive Testing

To run comprehensive tests for all combinations:

```bash
./run-cost-calculation-tests.sh
```

### Testing All Combinations

To test all possible combinations (may take longer):

```bash
./run-cost-calculation-tests.sh --all
```

### Generating a Report

To generate an HTML report of the test results:

```bash
./run-cost-calculation-tests.sh --report
```

### Testing Specific Combinations

To test specific combinations of parameters:

```bash
node test-specific-combination.mjs
```

Note: We use the `.mjs` extension to indicate that this is an ES module, which is required for this project since `package.json` contains `"type": "module"`.

## Validation Criteria

The tests validate the following criteria for each combination:

1. All required properties are present in the result
2. One-time frequencies are correctly identified
3. Annual cost is 0 for one-time items
4. Lifetime cost is greater than 0 for non-zero base rates
5. Cost range is valid (low ≤ average ≤ high)

## Extending the Tests

To add new test cases:

1. Add new combinations to the `generateTestCombinations` function in `testDataGenerator.ts`
2. Add specific test cases to `costCalculationMatrix.test.ts` for important scenarios
3. Update validation criteria in `runComprehensiveTests.js` if needed
4. Add specific test cases to `test-specific-combination.mjs` for debugging

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing approach ensures that all combinations of care services and frequencies are properly tested, helping to identify and fix any bugs or errors in the calculation logic. By running these tests regularly, you can maintain high confidence in the accuracy of your cost calculations.
