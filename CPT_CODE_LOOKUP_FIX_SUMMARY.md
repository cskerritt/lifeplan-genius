# CPT Code Lookup Fix Summary

## Problem

The application was showing $0 in the summary table because the CPT code lookup was failing. This was happening because:

1. The application had moved from using Supabase to direct database connections
2. The CPT code service was still using Supabase to look up CPT codes
3. This caused the fallback mechanism for CPT codes to not be triggered properly

## Solution

The solution was to update the CPT code service to use the direct database connection via `executeQuery` from `browserDbConnection.ts` instead of Supabase. This ensures that:

1. The CPT code lookup works correctly with the direct database connection
2. The fallback mechanism is triggered when needed
3. The summary table correctly displays cost values instead of $0

## Implementation

The key changes were:

1. Updated imports to use `executeQuery` from `browserDbConnection.ts` instead of Supabase
2. Updated the lookup function to use direct database query instead of Supabase RPC
3. Improved the validation of CPT code data to ensure the fallback mechanism works correctly
4. Updated the data access to use `result.rows` instead of `result.data`

## Testing

The fix was tested using:

1. A custom test script (`test-cpt-lookup-fix.mjs`) that verifies:
   - Direct CPT code lookup using the database connection
   - CPT code service functionality
   - Cost calculation flow with the updated CPT code service

2. A restart script (`restart_app_with_cpt_code_lookup_fix.mjs`) that:
   - Restarts the application with the fixed CPT code service
   - Starts the API server
   - Starts the Vite dev server

3. A browser script (`open_app_with_cpt_code_fix.mjs`) that:
   - Opens the application in a browser
   - Allows visual verification that the summary table now displays cost values

## Results

After applying this fix, the summary table now correctly displays cost values instead of $0. The CPT code lookup works correctly with the direct database connection, and the fallback mechanism provides sample data for CPT codes 99203 and 99214 when needed.
